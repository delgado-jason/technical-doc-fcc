# Bootstrap Technical Documentation

This site was built as part of [FreeCodeCamp's](www.freecodecamp.org) "Responsive Web Design Certification" course.

In no way is the content from this page mine. It came from Bootsrap's Getting Started page.

The sole purpose of building this site was to practice responsive web design, and to time myself to see how long the page took to build

## In Its Current State

### Design:
1 hour

### Production
7 hours

## Note to Self
Spend more time in the "design" phase. It will help you out in the long run and the site will reflect time spent with research and design
